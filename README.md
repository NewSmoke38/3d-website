So this is a veryyy basic 3d website through A-frame, it was my first time trying it and that too on an ipad so i kept it basic and learnt about a lot of things!

1. you open the website >>> https://factseeker3d.vercel.app/
2. you see a pink ball, you can control it with WASD keys to navigate through the obstacles.
3. get to the end.
4. get to know a fantastic random fact about the world by clicking on the top-left corner button ^_^
